# ReiDiscordBot
My work in progress personal project: a discord bot for my game (Priconne) discord server
## What it can do
- Read messages and respond to commands (pull  up spreadsheets, flip coin, funny replies)
- @mention discord roles for upcoming game updates in the server announcements(by decompressing json) credits to @EndenDragon (the absolute legend, thank you)
## How it works
- Initial set up through Discord developer portal
- Run/Coded in replit server
- changes/commits through replit version control
- hosted by UptimeRobot 

## Features in the works
- clan member queue system and boss attack role ping
